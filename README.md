Functional JavaScript utility library focused in performance, modularity, and functional pattern.

The idea of this project is a lightweight set of functions the will reduce the amount of code in your vanilla JS project

Basically you'll need any library or be attached to one framework instead of that this compile some partterns that are commonly used in different projects following the DRY approach focusing in functional programming

You'll have some parts of jQuery, loadash, angular, react and other libraries
